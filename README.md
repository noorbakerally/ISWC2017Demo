# ISWC2017Demo
A demonstration of an LDPizer for the ISWC Demo paper

## Reason for using an LDPizer  
LDPs are data-driven system and their deployment involves deploying both the data and the system. 
Current solutions for LDP addresse only the latter part. There is currently no solution for automatizing 
the deployment of data in LDP. An aim of LDPizer is to automatize the deployment of RDF and non-RDF data into LDPs.
